--1.Show every flight with its predecessor flight number — use LEFT JOIN so origin flights (no predecessor) appear with NULL--

SELECT
   f.flight_no AS current_flight,
   p.flight_no AS prev_flight
FROM flights f
LEFT JOIN flights p 
ON f.prev_flight_id = p.id;

--2.Show only flights that directly follow 'TK101' (i.e. where the predecessor flight is TK101)--

SELECT
   f.flight_no AS current_flight
FROM flights f 
JOIN flights p 
ON f.prev_flight_id = p.id
WHERE p.flight_no = 'TK101';

--3.Count how many onward connections each flight has (how many flights list it as predecessor), sorted descending--

SELECT 
   p.flight_no AS flight,
   COUNT(f.id) AS onward_connections
FROM flights p
LEFT JOIN flights f
ON f.prev_flight_id = p.id
GROUP BY p.id,p.flight_no
ORDER BY onward_connections DESC;

--4.Find flights where the predecessor's destination doesn't match the current flight's origin — a data-inconsistency check--

SELECT
   f.flight_no AS current_flight,
   p.flight_no AS prev_flight,
   p.destination AS prev_destination,
   f.origin AS current_origin
FROM flights f
JOIN flights p 
ON f.prev_flight_id = p.id
WHERE p.destination <> f.origin;
